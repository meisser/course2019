# Exercise 4 - Demographics

## Setting
Instead of probabilistic death, the agents now know how long they are going to live, namely for exactly 250 days. During the last 50 days, they will be in retirement. While retired, they do not work and live off their savings. The agents apply a simply savings and retirement heuristic that is based on a static view of the world, i.e. the agents do not take into account the changing demographics when planning their retirement.

## Task
You do not need to do any programming or run anything yourself this time. You can find all the required data online in [our simulation](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=ex4-demographics-1). Consider the data available under [demographics](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=ex4-demographics-1&metric=demographics) and [interest](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=ex4-demographics-1&metric=interest) and note that there is a download button to download the data for offline analysis. When analyzing the data, discard the first 500 days to make sure the initial conditions do not disort the result. How well can the demographics explain the changes of the interest rate? What is your interpretation? Do you think we can observe the same in the real world? 

## Deadline
