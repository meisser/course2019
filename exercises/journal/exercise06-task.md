# Final Exercise - Fund Competition

## Setting
The final setting is based on the latest [financial economy setting](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=financial-economy-fast) that includes a one-time productivity shock and allows leverage. We will slightly adjust the setting before the end of the class but the essentials will stay the same. See also the lecture notes. To run the setting locally, run the SimulationServer class as usual (located in the Arena project under src/com.agentecon.web).

## Task
Try to implement an investment fund with a successful investment strategy. The performance metric is the amount of money consumers made by investing in your fund. This includes dividend payments and realized capital gains, but not the unrealized capital gains when the simulation ends. Note that the length of the simulation might be subject to change. Your goal is to gain interesting and relevant insights by trying out different ideas to maximize the performance metric in competition with the others.

## Deadline and Delivarables
The deliverables are a presentation that documents the ideas you tried (about one presented idea per team member would be good), as well the code of your final fund agent. (I.e. you do not need to preserve the code of every idea you present, but only the code that you want to have in the final simulation run.)

Presentation dates are:
December 6th for team 1, 3, and 7.
December 13th for team 2, 5, 8, and 10.

The deadline for uploading the presentations and the latest changes of your agent is 14:00 on the day of your presentation. The duration of the presentation should be about 20 minutes, with equal time slots for all team members.

Of course, those teams who do not implement a fund but present a famous model instead do not need to hand in a fund agent (but might have other relevant computer code in case they tried out something). A presentation template can be found on the course website.

## Grading
The final grade will be based on how you did in the exercises as well as the presentation. The grading of the presentation depends on the contents of the presentation (most relevant), the code of your agent, and how well your agent did in the ranking. Regarding the code, the main criterion is its readability: are the methods and variables well-named and are the non-obvious things documented? Regarding the presentations, the grading factors are the quality (i.e. effectiveness and originality) of the presented ideas, how well you can explain why and how these ideas work, and (less important) a quick comment on whether you think these ideas could also work in the real world.
