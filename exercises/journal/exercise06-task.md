# Final Exercise - Fund Competition

## Setting
The final setting is based on the latest [financial economy setting](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=financial-economy-leverage) that includes a one-time productivity shock and allows leverage. We will slightly adjust the setting before the end of the class but the essentials will stay the same. 

## Task
Try to implement an investment fund with a successful investment strategy. The priority should be to gain interesting and relevant insights on the different investment strategies you tried out. How well your fund performed under what metric is a secondary, but not irrelevant concern. Metrics to look at include the stock price, the net wealth, and the dividends paid out by the fund.

## Deadline and Delivarables
The deliverables are a presentation and the code of your fund agent. Presentation dates are:
December 6th for team 1, 3, and 7.
December 13th for team 2, 5, 8, and 10.
The deadline for uploading the presentations and the latest changes of your agent is 14:00 on the day of your presentation. The duration of the presentation should be about 20 minutes.

Of course, those teams who do not implement a fund but present a famous model instead do not need to hand in a fund agent. A presentation template can be found on the course website.
